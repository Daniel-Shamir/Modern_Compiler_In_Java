2.1:
    a. c*ab(a | b | c)*
    b. (aa | b | c)*
    c. (0 | 1)*100
    d. ...

2.2:
    a. we need to keep track of a potentially infinite number, impossible in a finite automata.
    b. we need to check the first and last letters, but by the time the DFA gets to the last letter, it lost all the previous ones.
    c. we need to make sure brackets are balanced, i.e. ((3 + 5) is not syntactically correct, and the language of balanced brackets is not regular

2.3:
    a. all 4 digit binary numbers beginning in 1 or 00 or 010 or are 0111
    b. all strings under {a} where the number of occurrences of 'a' modulo 5 is 1

2.4:
